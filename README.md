Part 1: 
Step by step instructions on how to use and where to install Git, Github, and Jetbrains webstorm. 

1. Install jetbrains Webstorm using this link:  https://www.jetbrains.com/student/, this link will give you the option of applying for free access to the IDE using your NJIT email and a picture of your NJIT ID.
2. Install Git using https://git-scm.com/downloads, click on whichever operating system applies to you and download Git on your system.
3. Make a Github account at https://github.com/join, Github is used on the browser and so an account online is sufficient.
4. Now that all parts are set up, it is important to connect Git/GitHub to Webstorm. To do this, open Webstorm, go to setting menu, then system preferences. This is where you select Path to Git executable and the path should automatically pop up an option with your Git.
5. When starting a new project, open Webstorm, create a new project. In addition, you can create a new repository on GitHub, in Webstorm you can clone repository, and then enter the URL for your repository.
6. You can select file and choose whichever you want to create, whether this be HTML file, or a stylesheet for CSS typing.
7. Make sure to add Git in order to add, commit, and push your changes.
8. In order to commit or push, select, Git at the top, select commit or push, or both to do it simultaneously. Make sure to add a description so the changes are described properly. 


Part 2: 

**Branch**: This is a seperate line of development within your repository, however, changes in one branch will not affect the other branches until merged. 
**Clone**: A local version of the program taken from Github and put on your local device in order to edit. 
**Commit**: A method of saving your work to particular files. 
**Fetch**: Adds the changes made to files from the Github without committing anything.
**GIT**: A tool used for version control to help track changes made to files in a program.
**Github**: A web-based open source version control tool used to store Git repositories and help with collaboration. 
**Merge**: An operation that combines the work from one branch into the other. 
**Merge Conflict**: When two different commits apply some sort of changes to the same file and/or same lines of codes and Git can not automatically decide which change is the valid one. 
**Push**: After changes are made, the push command uploads the new changes from your local device to Github. 
**Pull**: Adds and merges the changes from Github into your local device as to not miss any changes made. 
**Remote**: A version of a repository or even a branch that is on a service such as GitHub.com
**Repository**: A folder/collection of all your project and code files with the version history as well.
